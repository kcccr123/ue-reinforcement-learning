<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Reinforcement learning framework designed specifically for integration with Unreal Engine.

Made for both developers and non-programmers, the library supports native code alongside Blueprint visual scripting, enabling users to implement learning agents within their Unreal projects regardless of their programming background.

The framework features a minimal setup process to get you started fast. Its design makes it straightforward to set up training environments and experiment with different reinforcement learning algorithms without hassle.
